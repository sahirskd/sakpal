“Canvas Chronicles: A Journey Through Form, Function & Feel”
Unfolding the Art of Visual Storytelling, One Sketch at a Time.

Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai, Maharashtra, INDIA

Acknowledgement
From the modest lanes of Ballabgarh to the hallowed halls of Sir J.J. School of Art, my journey has been nothing
short of a profound transformation—an odyssey of passion, perseverance, and purpose. With no prior exposure to
the artistic realm, it was the corridors of DAV Public School where the first sparks of creativity quietly flickered within
me. Each passing year, nurtured by the care of dedicated teachers and mentors, that flicker became a flame.
I bow in deep gratitude to my mother, the unwavering pillar of my life, whose faith, love, and sacrifices shaped the
artist I am today. Her strength and spirit continue to be the wind beneath my wings.
To the extraordinary faculty of Asia’s Best college Sir J.J. School of Art, Mumbai I owe a debt of immeasurable
appreciation. It was here that I was chiselled from a curious novice into a professional creator. I am especially grateful
to Prof. Dr. Vijay Sakpal, Prof. Vijay Bondar, and Prof. Vivek Sharma—the guiding stars whose wisdom, critique, and
mentorship sculpted my soul, transforming me from a raw learner into an artist with a global vision.
From navigating struggles to standing today with an identity that echoes across National and International platforms,
my heart swells with humility and pride. I often look back in wonder—at where I started, and where I stand today—
and each memory reaffirms the divine presence of those who believed in me.
To every Teacher, Professor, Mentor, and Guide, and most especially to my Dearest Mother—thank you. Your belief
became my becoming.
With hands folded in gratitude and a heart brimming with emotion,
Please accept my sincere and eternal gratitude.
– Prof. Rao Ranveer Siingh

Contemporary Indian Artist | Visual Philosopher | Master of Spiritual Realism
Early Life & Education
• Born in Mumbai, India, in 1968.
• Graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA, 1994) from the prestigious Sir J. J. School of Art, Mumbai.
• Deeply influenced by Indian visual traditions and spiritual philosophy.
Artistic Evolution & Influences
• Artistic journey spans over 30 years, shaped by discipline, introspection, and transcultural inspiration.
• Participated in international artist residencies in Germany and Switzerland.
• Exposure to European masters profoundly influenced his visual language and broadened his stylistic

Key thematic focus:

• Reimagines portraiture as sacred transmission rather than mere likeness.

• This technique adds a meditative quality and mirrors the transient nature of spiritual identity.
• Large-format paintings and sculptures evoke immersive, introspective spaces.

• Over 12 solo exhibitions since 2006.
• Notable exhibitions include:
